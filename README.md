# Cycler
## A Firefox addon which will rotate a tab through a set of pages

Add/Remove/Update pages to your list and watch your browser display them at set intervals.

Great for keeping an eye on different news sites + other interests

## TODO:
- Add a remove button to list entries
- No duplicated nicknames
- No duplicated urls (exact). Would allow both e.g reddit.com and reddit.com/r/programming
- Add a "add current page" button
- Add start/stop cycle button
- Style the popup
- Implement the timer to change the webpage
- Individual times per entry?? 

### Developing this addon
Install web-ext
`npm i --global web-ext`
Run:
`web-ext run`
